# TripTipper

The App can be loaded into an android device with GPS and vibration capabilities.
I tested mainly on a Galaxy Nexus API 28. It should also have external storage. 

The included Trip.gpx file can be loaded 
into the AVD to see a demonstration of the app as it moves between and through 
stations. The effects can be viewed on the Trip tab.

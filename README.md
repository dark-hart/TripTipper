# TripTipper

The App can be loaded into an android device with GPS and vibration capabilities.
I tested mainly on a Galaxy Nexus API 28. It should also have external storage,
although that functionality does not appear to be working. 

The switch toggles on the menu tab can be pressed, but they do not seem to be 
writing to a file like they should be. The included Trip.gpx file can be loaded 
into the AVD to see a demonstration of the app as it moves between and through 
stations. The effects can be viewed on the Trip tab.
